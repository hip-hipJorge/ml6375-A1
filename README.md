# ml4375-A1

## Description
There are two parts to this assignment. The first part requires the
implementation of code that uses gradient descent for linear regression. <br>
In the second part, a ML library is used on the same data set to compare 
your results.

## Contains
- part1.py
- linear_grad_desc.py (imported implemented modules)
- part2.py
- README.md
- CS4375_CoverPage 

## Run Instructions
Once in directory, enter one of two command (dependent on machine):

python [filename].py <br>
or <br>
python3 [filename].py

## All Necessary Libraries/Imports
import pandas as pd
from linear_grad_desc import *
import requests
import io
from linear_grad_desc import list_format
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
